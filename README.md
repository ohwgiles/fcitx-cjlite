fcitx-cjlite
============

A pragmatic take on cangjie5 for day to day use.

- The fcitx disambiguation popup should never show, i.e. there are no collisions.
- Rare characters and those that have no glyphs in common fonts are stripped
- Collisions are sorted by frequency in Chinese language, collision key x is prepended to the least common
